## Step Input
Q1. Write a function `pay(hours:float, rate:float)->float`, where `hours` is the number of hours that an employee has worked in a week and `rate` is the pay that employee receives per hour. If the employee works for more than 40 hours in a week, the employee should be paid 1.5 times their regular rate for each hour over 40.

Return the amount the employee would be paid for the hours of work given, taxes should not be considered. 


## Example Cases:
```
pay(5.0,12.0) => 60.0
pay(10.0,15.0) => 150.0
pay(100.0, 150.5) => 15050
```
Q2. Write a function `split_apples(apples:int, children:int) ->int` that takes in an amount of apples and a number of children. The function should distribute `apples` evenly across all `children`. The function should return the whole number of apples each child will get after distributing the apples evenly. Assume that both `apples` and `children` are positive whole numbers.

## Example Cases:
```
split_apples(10, 2) => 5
split_apples(7, 2) => 3
split_apples(100, 100) => 1
split_apples(1, 2) => 0
```
Q3. Write a function `profit(base:float, sale:float, manufacturing_cost:float)->float` that represents how much money the profit a company makes on an item on sale. The original price of the item, `base` has a percentage off (represented as an integer) `sale` , such that the price to the consumer is `sale` percent less than the `base` price. The `manufacturing_cost` is the price of the creation of the item. Return the profit that the company makes after the item is sold, given that the company had to spend `manufacturing_cost` to create the item. Reminder: Profit = Price - Cost.

## Example Cases:
```
profit(100, 0.2, 30) => 50
profit(50, 0.5, 30) => -5
profit(20, 0.1, 10) => 8
profit(15, 0.35, 8) => 9.75
```

## Step Response
A1. ```
def pay(hours, rate):
